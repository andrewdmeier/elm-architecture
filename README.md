# [The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) in JavaScript

## Features
- **Original taste** - Code structure is almost the same as The Elm Architecture in elm.
- **Virtual DOM library agnostic** - It works with React, Snabbdom, Deku or any virtual DOM library.
- **Typed language friendly** - Since messages are typed, languages such as  TypeScript can be helpful via feature like [instanceof type guards](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html).
- **Reactive stream library support** - It comes with an observable model, you can use RxJS, Most.js or xstream to transform it.
